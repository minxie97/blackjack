            The goal in Blackjack is to get as close to 21 without going over, If you do you 'Bust’. Cards all have set values, all numbered cards have their written value (2-10) and face cards
            (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 each. Ace is special and worth 11 pts. If you have an Ace and
            you go bust the Ace will change into a 1. The game begins with the Dealer dealing all players 2 cards
            each. All cards are  dealt face down so only the players knows their value. The dealer will show one card of their hand and have the
            other face down, the dealer only reveals both cards if they have a natural 21(Ace + 10 point card). After everyone 
            is dealt the game begins. The player is allowed to ‘Hit’ or ‘Stand’. Hit means the player will take another
            card off of the top of the deck adding it to their total. Stand means that the player is done with their turn and can do no other moves until the
            hand is over. After the player ‘Stands’ the dealer will flip their hidden card and hit until they hit 17 or higher.
            If the dealer starts with 17 or higher, they will automatically ‘Stand’. Whoever is closer to 21 without ‘Busting’ wins.
